# Student_Record
Record the data of student in java by passing and returning objects to a method

Passing object(s) to a method:
                              This program takes the specified data i.e. Student name, age, department and section as input from user. Here in this program, 2 classes are created. 
In First class, variables are declared. In the Second class, one constructor is created in which object is passed as parameter. So, there is no need to declare the variables separately in second class.
This is the advantage of passing object as parameter. 



Q. What are the advantages of passing objects as parameter instead of values?

•	Passing values instead of Objects will create copy of variables.
•	It doesn’t make copy of variables.
•	It allows a method to change the values of variable.
•	It can return multiple values from a method.
•	It improves performance.
•	By passing object as parameter, Program executing will take less time.
•	data or simple we can say, in case of large number of variables.




Returning object(s) from a method:
                                This program is somehow same as the above. But there is only one class that is Student. In this class four variable (Name, Age, Department, Section) are declared. Then through Constructor, values are assigned to variables. There is only one method getStudentInfo ( ). This method returns object which is the requirement of our program.
